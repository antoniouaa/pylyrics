lyrics = "\n\r\nShot through the heart\nAnd you're to blame\nDarling, you give love a bad name\n\nAn angel's smile is what you sell\nYou promise me heaven, then put me through hell\nChains of love got a hold on me\nWhen passion's a prison, you can't break free\n\nOh, oh, you're a loaded gun\nOh, oh, there's nowhere to run\nNo one can save me\nThe damage is done\n\nShot through the heart\nAnd you're to blame\nYou give love a bad name (bad name)\nI play my part\nAnd you play your game\nYou give love a bad name (bad name)\nYou give love\nA bad name\n\nPaint your smile on your lips\nBlood red nails on your fingertips\nA school boy's dream, you act so shy\nYour very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye\n\nOh, oh, you're a loaded gun\nOh, oh, there's nowhere to run\nNo one can save me\nThe damage is done\n\nShot through the heart\nAnd you're to blame\nYou give love a bad name (bad name)\nI play my part\nAnd you play your game\nYou give love a bad name (bad name)\nYou give love\n\nShot through the heart\nAnd you're to blame\nYou give love a bad name\nI play my part\nAnd you play your game\nYou give love a bad name (bad name)\n\nShot through the heart\nAnd you're to blame\nYou give love a bad name (bad name)\nI play my part\nAnd you play your game\nYou give love a bad name (bad name)\nYou give love\nYou give love (bad name)\nYou give love\nYou give love (bad name)\nYou give love\nYou give love (bad name)\nYou give love\nYou give love (bad name)\n"
